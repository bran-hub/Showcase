## Introduction:

My name is *Brandon*. I am a **University of Waterloo** graduate (*BA Economics, Finance Specialization*). My professional experience exposed me to *investment management* in different domains within the **financial services industry**. If you would like to learn more about my background, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonhubah/).

My **goal** is to develop my technical skills in data analytics and pursue a career in FinTech. *Some job titles that I am interested in include Capital Markets Business Analyst and Quantitative Researcher.*

I chose FinTech as a career path based on my previous experiences in the financial services. I witnessed first-hand how traditional ways of doing analysis in finance are becoming obsolete. The modern financial analyst needs to have computer science skills to be able to analyze large datasets and extract insights in order to make informed decisions and remain competitve in business.
